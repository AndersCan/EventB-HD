\section{Problems}
-- Eclipse plugin system is prone to errors, "missing dependency X"
-- Rodin editor feels bloated
--- Required to add multiple plugins to get "decent" value.
--- Refactoring far too time consuming
--- XML Source not designed for readability
---- Using ASCI symbols instead of just number to represent line numbers.
--- Upgrades to RODIN have no clear benefits. Version 2.8 has more features that 3.2. Versions after 2.7, some/most plugins break for no clear reason.
--- Adding while removing functionality should not occur. 
----- For every 1 machine/context, there are created 4 additional files. If these are required or auto-generated is hard to determine. When using a VCS you do not want to upload generated files.  
----- PO must be opened amd SMT be run for almost all proofs.

---- Rodin does not allow (easily) to add comments
--- Adding and removing lines in rodin take far too much effort

Event b without an Animator is quite worthless?
