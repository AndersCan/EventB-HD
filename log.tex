10.02.16 - First meeting with Mery to discuss project. Given "The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study" by Atif Mashkoor. Scheduled new meeting for Wednesday 16 @ 10.30. Shall present a potential sketch for an event-b model.
Notes:
* Proposing models in Event-B and translate them to Machine deployable code
* Show events easily translated to C-code
* PEMS is Dialysis machine
* No requirement for a fully modeled system, but highly desireable.
* Final goal - Library of transformations

16.02.16 - Second meeting 
* Read, then describe the HD machine at a high level. Use Diagrams to describe the system.
* Identify what will be in Event-B
* What refinement to use
* Conclusion - Add features to Event-B (Extensions)
* Summerize what is missing in Rodin-Platform for analysing the HD machine.

#2 Study the required Event-B extensions
  Elements that can not be modeled
  --> What are other languages doing?
  --> Study Hybrid Event-B
What can you do in B?
Provide tools for translation
