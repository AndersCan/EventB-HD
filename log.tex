10.02.15 - First meeting with Mery to discuss project. Given "The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study" by Atif Mashkoor. Scheduled new meeting for Wednesday 16 @ 10.30. Shall present a potential sketch for an event-b model.
Notes:
* Proposing models in Event-B and translate them to Machine deployable code
* Show events easily translated to C-code
* PEMS is Dialysis machine
* No requirement for a fully modeled system, but highly desireable.
* Final goal - Library of transformations
